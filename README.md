his repository contains documentation for setting up a comprehensive network infrastructure tailored for a multi-departmental organization. It outlines the implementation of various networking concepts such as VLANs, subnetting, DHCP, OSPF routing, NAT, and access control lists to establish efficient communication channels and streamline data management.

Key Components:

ISP and core routers
Multilayer and regular switches
PCs, laptops, tablets
Access points
Printers
Servers (DHCP, HTTP, DNS)
Implemented Technologies:

Basic device settings for hostname, password, and SSH for secure access
VLAN assignment and port configuration for traffic segmentation
Switch port security measures
Subnetting and IP addressing for efficient network communication
OSPF configuration for dynamic routing
Static IP assignment to critical server room devices
DHCP server configuration for automated IP address assignment
DNS server configuration for domain name resolution
HTTP server configuration for hosting web pages
Inter-VLAN routing for communication between different VLANs
Wireless network configuration for wireless device connectivity
NAT implementation for internet access
Access control lists for network security
Conclusion:
The network infrastructure setup has significantly enhanced communication, collaboration, and data management capabilities within the organization. It provides a scalable and secure foundation for future expansion while ensuring data integrity and network security.
